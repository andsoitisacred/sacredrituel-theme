Antioxidants like vitamin C and E work to neutralize harmful free radicals, protecting cells from damage and inflammation. Biotin, or vitamin B7, helps to improve cell turnover, promoting healthy hair and nails as well as a smooth complexion. And let's not forget about good old vitamin A, also known as retinol - this powerhouse ingredient stimulates collagen production and improves skin elasticity. They are foundational to promoting the overall health and vitality of your skin cells.</p>",

Thankfully , there are plenty of safe ways to feed your skin the nutrition it needs and that starts with choosing organic. </p><p>Vegetables are a great source of vitamins and nutrients, while non-organic vegetables often lack the quantity and quality compared to organic.  First, organic ingredients have more potent nutrients and they are free from chemicals and pesticides that enter your body.  Why would you put harmful chemicals on your body if you have a choice? That's why it's important to choose organic whenever possible. Not only will you be doing your skin a favor, but you'll also be doing your body a big favor! It's no secret that a healthy diet leads to healthy skin.  But what many people don't know is that the key to beautiful skin lies in vitamins and nutrients. </p>",

We often associate antioxidants with fruits and vegetables, but did you know that the same phytonutrients found in plant-based foods can also benefit our skin? These plant compounds, commonly referred to as phytonutrients, work by combating harmful free radicals and promoting cell regeneration. Phytonutrients also help skin retain its youthful firmness by increasing the stability of cellular membranes and improving blood flow through the skin. Our formulas contain phytonutrient-rich extracts such as Jojoba, Blackberry, Rose Hip, Seabuckthorn and green tea to boost antioxidants to combat the environmental stresses our skin was designed to protect us from.</p><p> Below are some of the best vitamins and nutrients for beautiful skin, along with tips on how to get them into your skincare routine.</p>",

Polyphenol Flavonoids, such as the anthocyanins found in the blue and purples hues of fruits like grapes and blueberries, supercharge circulatory health.</p><p>The flavonoids are a class of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds that provide us with powerful antioxidants. Quercetin, found in many fruits and vegetables, is a plant-pigment and flavonoid found in berries, green tea leaf and moringa leaf all of which are ingredients in SACRED SERUM. It can be consumed orally as a supplement and applied topically through skincare products for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Carotenoids including beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene protect against the harmful effects of UV radiation. Allicin and quercetin are two of the important phytonutrients due to their antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties, these compounds help boost collagen production safely and naturally.</p>",

            "body": "<p>You're likely already well-acquainted with clean, organic, and non-toxic beauty labels.  A product marked as  “organic” and “biodynamic” refers to how ingredients are grown and harvested, “cold-pressed” refers to how ingredients are processed from a plant or seed to an oil. When oils are cold-pressed, they are extracted from their source using mechanical methods rather than heat or solvents and undergoes very little processing which allows it to retain its important nutrients responsible for healing.</p><p>Cold-pressed oils have the upper hand on their heat or chemically processed counterparts in more ways than one. For starters, one study showed increased antioxidant capacity with cold pressing - and this means better protection for your skin! It also noted an increase of tocopherols which are natural preservatives meaning that cold-pressed oils have a naturally longer shelf life, and can often forgo fillers and synthetic preservatives. Cold pressing delivers a potent product that's highly effective AND safe because there aren't any additives whatsoever. It’s a win/win for your skin.</p>",
